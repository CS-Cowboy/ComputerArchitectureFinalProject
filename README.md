Final project for Computer Architecture. 

The goal was to demonstrate the knowledge and skills developed in class & projects. It could be anything but I chose to do a standard deviation calculation in ARMv8 assembly (in addition to getting the makefile going). My partners Mark H. and Brian produced the code for selection sort and the mean median mode files.
